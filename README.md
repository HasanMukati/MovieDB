# MovieDB

In this project I used Node, React and an online Movie database and API
to create a web application that allowed me to search for any movie by
title. By connecting to the MovieDB API while adding custom CSS and UI 
to format the results I was able to create a functional user experience 
along with an extra function that allows users to "view" and learn more; 
all the data comes from MovieDB and their API. I will continue to work with
different API's and create programs like these. 

If you have any questions or suggestions please let me know.

*Please intall node modules for code to run*

using terminal: npm install -g node-modules


Thank you!
